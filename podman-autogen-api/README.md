# podman-autogen-api

Auto generated podman REST API client using [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

It's not super useful without the wrappers provided by [podman-rest-client](https://github.com/blazzy/podman-rest-client) to allow for connections over unix sockets and ssh connections. It's reccomended that you use [that crate](https://docs.rs/podman-rest-client) instead.
